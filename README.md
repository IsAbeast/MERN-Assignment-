## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of MongoDB, including:
- Setting up a database and collections
- Performing CRUD operations
- Writing advanced queries (filtering, projection, sorting, pagination)
- Using aggregation pipelines
- Implementing indexing for performance
- Dropping collections and databases

The main script is [insert_book.js](insert_book.js), which contains the whole database.
Another script is the [`queries.js`](queries.js), which contains **all insert commands, queries, and cleanup steps**.
